Kernel Module Installation Instructions
Arati Banerjee, Huong Dang, Jorge Brandon Nunez

1.  Open your terminal.

2.  Navigate to the directory with the two source files and the Makefile in it.

3.  Type
    	make
    into the terminal to build the kernel modules.

4.  Type
    	sudo insmod charkmod-in.ko
    	sudo insmod charkmod-out.ko
    into the terminal to install the kernel modules, in that specific order.

5.  Type
    	dmesg
    into the terminal to determine the major numbers for the kernel modules.
    For example, our VM usually assigned charkmod-in the major number 246,
    and it assigned charkmod-out the major number 245.

6.  Type
    	sudo mknod /dev/charkmod-in c <major_number> 0
    	sudo mknod /dev/charkmod-out c <major_number> 0
    into the terminal to create the separate virtual devices.
    For example, in our VM, we typed
    	sudo mknod /dev/charkmod-in c 246 0
    	sudo mknod /dev/charkmod-out c 245 0
    to create our devices.

7.  Type
    	sudo chmod 777 /dev/charkmod-in
    	sudo chmod 777 /dev/charkmod-out
    into the terminal to allow global read-write access, for the sake of
    convenience. If you know your permissions, feel free to use chmod as you
    desire.

8.  Type
    	sudo chmod +x ./tester-in.sh
    	sudo chmod +x ./tester-out.sh
    into the terminal to allow execution of our bash scripts. These scripts
    barrage the device interfaces endlessly with read-write demands when
    executed.

9.  Open a second terminal and navigate to the same working directory the first
    terminal is located in. Then, in one terminal, type
    	sudo ./tester-in.sh
    and in the other terminal, type
    	sudo ./tester-out.sh
    to force a stream of mutex conflicts. When you want to let the VM breathe,
    press CTRL-C on each terminal window to stop the looping scripts.

10. To uninstall everything, type the following commands in one of the
    terminals IN THIS ORDER (because charkmod-out depends on charkmod-in):
    	sudo rm /dev/charkmod-out
    	sudo rm /dev/charkmod-in
    	sudo rmmod charkmod-out
    	sudo rmmod charkmod-in
    	make clean

Congratulations! You've tested our kernel module successfully!
